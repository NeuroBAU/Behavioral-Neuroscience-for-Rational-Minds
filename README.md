# Behavioral-Neuroscience-for-Rational-Minds

## Course description
The main goal of the course is to support students in the development of the mindset necessary to both (i) design unbiased experiments and (ii) obtain reproducible results in behavioral neuroscience. To this end, the course will take advantage of a modern framework derived from the field of artificial intelligence to rationalize and operationalize complex concepts in behavioral neuroscience. During the course students will learn a system that eases the transition from traditional behavioral assays to computational behavioral studies that take advantage of modern in-vivo imaging/recording techniques in freely-moving animals. The course will end with a one day-module dedicated to the use of different behavioral models and how to use those models to perform translational studies of human pathologies.

**Theory of mind imposes a limit to the inferences we make from observed / manifest behavior. The experiment of Heider and Simmel shows that we may attribute behavioral and mental states even to inanimate objects.**

**Introduction to the fundamentals of cognitive psychology - interesting historical reading, I found particularly interesting the concept of "memory cell". Posner is not referring to an actual cell, but rather to a portion of space in a memory system. Influences from computer science and Hebb's ideas are particularly relevant.**

**We do not understand how artificial neural networks form and use representations despite their simple units and full experimental access to the network (is this a new wave of behaviorism?). We adopt the same approach in biological neural networks (i.e. gathering data from large numbers of biological neurons). Is this approach doomed to fail?.**
