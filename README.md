## Course description ##

The main goal of the course is to support students in the development of the mindset necessary to both (i) design unbiased experiments and (ii) obtain reproducible results in behavioral neuroscience. To this end, the course will take advantage of a modern framework derived from the field of artificial intelligence to rationalize and operationalize complex concepts in behavioral neuroscience. During the course students will learn a system that eases the transition from traditional behavioral assays to computational behavioral studies that take advantage of modern in-vivo imaging/recording techniques in freely-moving animals. The course will end with a one day-module dedicated to the use of different behavioral models and how to use those models to perform translational studies of human pathologies.
